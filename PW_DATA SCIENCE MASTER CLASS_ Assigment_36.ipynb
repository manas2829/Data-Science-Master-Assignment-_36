    "### Ans:-\n",
    "       The margin of error is a measure of the uncertainty or range of values around an estimated statistic, typically used \n",

    "       The margin of error indicates the likely difference between the population parameter and the sample estimate.\n",
    "        \n",
    "      The formula for the margin of error is typically based on the standard deviation of the population, the desired level\n",

    "                            size (√Sample Size) accounts for the effect of sample size on the margin of error.\n",
    "\n",
    "        A larger sample size generally results in a smaller margin of error. As the sample size increases, the standard \n",
    "        error of the estimate decreases because the variability between individual observations tends to cancel out. With \n",
